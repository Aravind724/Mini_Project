 PREDICTION OF PRE-OWNED CAR PRICES USING MACHINE LEARNING

  The model we were making is to predict the value of a second- hand car prices using machine
 learning techniques. We have collected the data of cars from Kaggle having attributes like
 different cars and their year, km driven, fuel type, model name, company etc. The data is then
 processed using different algorithms where we chose linear regression and random forest
 algorithms and compared them. It would be available in GUI as a Web application developed
 using Python streamlit framework  making it user-friendly so that users could give input and get the price of a
 car according to it. Using data machine and machine learning approaches, our project
 proposed a scalable framework for pre-owned car prices prediction.
 
 An efficient machine learning model is built by training, testing, and evaluating  machine
 learning regression  named random forest regression , The increased prices of
 new cars and the financial incapability of the customers to buy them, used car sales are on a
 global increase. There is an urgent need for a Pre- Owned car price prediction system which
 effectively determines the worthiness of the car using a variety of features. The proposed
 system will help to determine the accurate price of pre- owned car price prediction.
 
 Prediction of preâ€“ owned car prices using machine learning is a complex task that require
 careful consideration of various factors, including data quality, future engineering, model
 selection and hyperparameter tuning. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and
 techniques, we can develop accurate and reliable predictive models that help buyers, sellers,
 and dealers make informed decisions.
